# Explain the difference between state and props in React.

In React, both state and props are used to manage data and communicate between components, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

## State:

- State is a JavaScript object that belongs to a component and is managed internally by that component.
- It represents the mutable data that can change over time, typically in response to user actions, server responses, or other events.
- State is initialized within a component using the useState hook (in functional components) or the this.state object (in class components).
- Changes to the state trigger re-renders of the component, updating the UI to reflect the new state.
- State should be used for data that is local to a component and not shared with other components unless necessary. Each component manages its own state independently.
## Props:

- Props (short for properties) are immutable data passed from a parent component to a child component.
- They are used to customize or configure a child component by providing it with data or behavior from its parent component.
- Props are passed down from parent components to child components through attributes, similar to HTML attributes.
- Unlike state, props are read-only for the child component. They cannot be modified within the child component.
- Props are typically used for passing data from a parent component to a child component, such as configuration options, event handlers, or dynamic content.
- Changes to props in the parent component can trigger re-renders of the child component with the updated prop values.

  
In summary, state is used for managing mutable data within a component, while props are used for passing immutable data from parent components to child components. Understanding the difference between state and props is essential for effectively managing data flow and building modular, reusable components in React applications.
