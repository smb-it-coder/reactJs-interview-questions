# why use static into static getDerivedStateFromError(error) in reactjs

The static keyword is used with getDerivedStateFromError(error) in React.js for two main reasons:

- **Class-Level Method:** static methods are defined directly on the class itself, not on the component instance.
   This means they can be accessed without needing an instance of the component. In the case of getDerivedStateFromError,
   it's called during the rendering phase, even before an instance is fully created. By making it static, React can call it directly on the class to handle the error.

- **Shared Logic:** static methods are typically used to define utility functions or logic that is shared across all instances of the class.
   **getDerivedStateFromError** serves a specific purpose within error boundaries, and making it static ensures that
  the error handling logic is defined in one place and can be reused for any component that inherits from the error boundary class.

## Here's a breakdown of why static is important:

- **Without static:** If getDerivedStateFromError wasn't static, you would need to define it on the component instance itself
   (inside the constructor or using an arrow function). However, during the rendering phase when errors might occur,
   the component instance might not be fully initialized yet.
  This could lead to errors trying to access instance properties or methods before they exist.

- **With static:** By making it static, the method is defined on the class itself,
   independent of the component instance. React can call it directly on the class
   to determine the state update based on the thrown error, even before a full instance is created.

  In summary, the static keyword ensures that getDerivedStateFromError is accessible and reusable within the context of error boundaries
   in React class components. It allows for clean separation of error handling logic and promotes code maintainability.
